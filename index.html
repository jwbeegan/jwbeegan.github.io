        <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Beegan and I am a programmer striving to create interesting and innovative games.
            I graduated from Purdue University with Honors in the spring of 2021.
            I have been working on my own games since 2022, and released MechAvenger, a VR platformer shooter on Steam in January 2024. 
        </p>
        <p>           
            I have also worked full-time as a PLC programmer for Hurco Companies Inc. since November 2021. In my time there, I have
            worked on complex, critical problems under tight deadlines. I have also acted as a
            liaison with international partners to fix production issues. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Working on my games has been my passion for the last 3 years. From the initial prototypes,
            to releasing finished products, I enjoy the entire process. I am always improving my skills with new programming languages, game making strategies and design techniques.
        </p><p>
            When I am not developing or playing games I enjoy spending time with my family and my pets, exercising and playing Magic: The Gathering. 
            I am currently looking for new oppurtunities, so contact me if you would like to chat!

                <p>MechAvenger is my first game, not counting game jams and student projects. This was a solo project, so I was responsible 
                    for the coding, design, music and SFX. MechAvenger focuses on fast paced VR shooter combat as well as 
                    challenging climbing and platforming. You can find out more about MechAvenger <a href="/mechAvenger.html">here</a>.

            <p>Blackjack is a demo I created to practice and showcase my programming skills. The demo is small in scope so that
                I could focus explciitly on writing clean, efficient and extendable code. I published the code for Blackjack on my 
                Github profile.

            <p> Below are the two game jam games I have made. Each was made with a small team of 4 or 5 for the GMTK Game Jam 2023 and 2022, respectively.
                For each, I was responsible for programming while also providing some design assistance.
